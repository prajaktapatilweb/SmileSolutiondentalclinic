             What is Root Canal Treatment (RCT)?
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
Root canal treatment, often referred to as RCT, is a dental procedure designed to remove infected or damaged pulp (the soft tissue inside your tooth containing nerves and blood vessels) from the tooth's root canal. This treatment cleans and disinfects the inside of the tooth, which is then filled and sealed to prevent further infection. It's a highly effective way to relieve pain and save a tooth that would otherwise need to be extracted. If youâ€™re experiencing severe tooth pain or sensitivity, visiting an endodontic clinic near you can help diagnose the issue early and provide expert care to restore your dental health.
