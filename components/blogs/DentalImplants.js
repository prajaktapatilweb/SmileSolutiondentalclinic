     <h3>Expert Insights from Dr. Heeral Chikhal & Dr. Kalpesh Dey</h3>
      <p>
      Missing teeth can affect more than just your smile‚Äîthey can impact your confidence, chewing ability, and even your bone health. Dental implants have emerged as the gold standard for tooth replacement, but are they really worth the investment?
      </p>
      <p>
      We asked two leading dental experts from Mumbai‚Äî<b>Dr. Heeral Chikhal (MDS ‚Äì Prosthodontics & Implantology)</b> and <b>Dr. Kalpesh Dey (MDS ‚Äì Endodontics & Cosmetic Dentistry)</b>‚Äîto share their professional opinion. Both have <b>13+ years of experience</b>, are <b>former Assistant Professors at Government Dental College, Mumbai,</b> and specialize in advanced, long-term dental solutions.

      <h3>What Are Dental Implants?</h3>
      <p>
      A dental implant is a titanium post that functions like a natural tooth root. It is surgically embedded into the jawbone and topped with a custom crown, bridge, or denture. Over time, the implant fuses with the bone (osseointegration), making it one of the most stable and natural-feeling replacements available.      </p>

<p>‚ÄúWe always guide patients with clarity‚Äîimplants are not just about aesthetics. They‚Äôre about restoring confidence and long-term oral health. We consider bone health, general health, and lifestyle before recommending implants.‚Äù
